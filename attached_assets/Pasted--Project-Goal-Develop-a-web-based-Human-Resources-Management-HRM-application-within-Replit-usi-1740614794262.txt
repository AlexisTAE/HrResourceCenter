**Project Goal:** Develop a web-based Human Resources Management (HRM) application within Replit using React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL for the backend.

**Application Name:** (You can choose a name, e.g., "Workforce Manager," "Company Hub," etc.)

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:**
    * React (Create React App)
    * Tailwind CSS (for styling)
    * JavaScript
* **Backend:**
    * Node.js (Express.js for API)
    * MySQL (for database)
* **Replit Environment:**
    * Utilize Replit's workspace for development, deployment, and database setup.

**Core Features and Requirements:**

**1. Company Panel (Dashboard & Worker Management):**

* **Dashboard:**
    * Provide a summary overview of key HR metrics (e.g., number of employees, pending permit requests).
    * Include quick access links to other sections of the application.
* **Authentication:**
    * Implement user authentication (login/logout) to secure the application.
    * Consider role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between admin and supervisor functionalities.
* **Worker Resources (CRUD):**
    * Enable administrators to manage worker data.
    * Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for worker records.
    * Provide file upload functionality for importing worker data from .txt, .csv, and .xlsx files.
    * The worker table should have at least these fields: id, name, lastname, department, role, supervisorID.

**2. Roles and Permissions Management:**

* Create a dedicated page to manage company roles and permissions.
* Allow administrators to:
    * Create new roles.
    * Assign specific permissions to each role.
    * View and modify existing roles and permissions.

**3. Organization Chart (Basic Representation):**

* Generate a visual representation of the company's organizational structure.
* Display employees with their associated roles and departments.
* Focus on a clear, hierarchical list-based representation (no complex graphical rendering or calculations required).
* The organization chart should show the supervisor of each worker.

**4. Permit Request Management:**

* **Permit Request Creation:**
    * Allow employees to submit permit requests (e.g., time off, leave).
    * Include fields for:
        * Employee name.
        * Permit type.
        * Start/end dates.
        * Reason.
* **Request History:**
    * Display a list of all permit requests.
    * Filter and display pending requests for supervisors.
    * The permit request table should have at least these fields: id, workerID, permitType, startDate, endDate, reason, status, supervisorID.

**5. Proof of Work Management:**

* **Proof of Work Generation (PDF):**
    * Generate a PDF document containing proof of employment for a worker.
    * Include:
        * Worker's personal information (name, etc.).
        * Company information.
        * Authorizing signature (placeholder or image upload).
* **Worker Information Display:**
    * Display the worker's details within the proof of work view.
* **Supervisor Notification:**
    * Implement a notification system to alert the HR supervisor when a proof of work request is generated.

**Backend API Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/api/workers` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `/api/roles` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* `/api/permits` (GET, POST, PUT)
* `/api/proofs` (POST)
* `/api/auth/login` (POST)
* `/api/auth/logout` (POST)

**Database Schema (MySQL - Basic):**

* `workers` (id, name, lastname, department, role, supervisorID)
* `roles` (id, name, permissions)
* `permits` (id, workerID, permitType, startDate, endDate, reason, status, supervisorID)
* `users` (id, username, password, role)

**Development Steps (Recommended):**

1.  **Replit Setup:** Create a new Replit workspace with a React.js template.
2.  **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
3.  **Backend Setup:** Create a Node.js/Express.js backend and connect to a MySQL database within Replit.
4.  **Authentication:** Implement user authentication.
5.  **Database Models:** Define database models for workers, roles, permits, and users.
6.  **API Development:** Build the necessary API endpoints.
7.  **Frontend Component Development:** Create React components for each feature.
8.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test each feature and API endpoint.
9.  **Deployment (Replit):** Deploy the application using Replit's deployment features.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in both the frontend and backend.
* **Security:** Follow security best practices to protect user data.
* **User Experience (UX):** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
* **Clear and concise code:** Code should be easy to read and maintain.

**Deliverables:**

* A functional React application hosted on Replit.
* Source code for the frontend and backend.
* A basic database schema.
